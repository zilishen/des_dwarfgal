# des_dwarfgal
## This is a repository for the code I am experimenting on for DES data. 
The code is meant to be hosted on NOAO datalab. The exception is the .py files related to DBscan which were run on TACC in parallel. Those codes are here for complete information, but the results are stored in dbscan_results/ so in principle you don't need to rerun them.
